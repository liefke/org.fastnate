<!-- 
This is an example for the generic XML import.

Every XML file in (data folder)/entities is read. 

If the file name matches an entity name and the entity class is annotated with "@XmlRootElement" JAXB is used to read the file.

Otherwise the file is read with a generic approach, which tries to support all JPA properties in entity classes:
* The name and attributes of the root element are ignored, it is just used as a container element
* Each child element of the root element has to be the name of an entity.
* Each singular property may either be an attribute or a child element with text content.
* Each plural property is an XML element with a child element for each entry.
* Date and time properties are either in the formats as defined in ISO 8601 (yyyy-mm-dd)
  or in the most common formats dd.mm.yyyy resp. mm/dd/yyyy (see DateConverter)
* For boolean properties every "true", "1", "on", "x", y*, s*, o* or j* evaluates to true
  everything else evaluates to false (see BooleanConverter)
* If the property contains an entity:
** new entities may be "inlined", with the same rules as the ones from the root entities
** existing entities may be referenced by their unique value either by
*** defining the property in an attribute
*** or setting the attribute "reference" to "true" in the property element
