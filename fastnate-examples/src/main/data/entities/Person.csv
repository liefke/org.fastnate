#
# This is an example file for the generic CSV import.
# 
# The default column delimiter is ",".
# You can change this by setting the property "fastnate.csv.delimiter.column".
# 
# Comment lines start with "#" or "/*".
# 
# Column names are mapped case insensitive to the properties of the entity, 
# which is identified by the name of the file or directory (in this case "Person").
#
# Properties that reference entities are looked up by their unique value.
#
# Plural properties are split at ",".
# You can change this by setting the property "fastnate.csv.delimiter.collection"
#
# Date and time properties are either in the formats as defined in ISO 8601 (yyyy-mm-dd)
# or in the most common formats dd.mm.yyyy resp. mm/dd/yyyy (see DateConverter)
# 
# For boolean properties every true, 1, on, x, y*, s*, o* or j* evaluates to true
# everything else evaluates to false (see BooleanConverter)
# 
# The referenced organisations are defined in organisations.csv
